# LENDSQR FRONTEND ENGINEERING TEST

This is a mini application created for the Lendsqr-Frontend test interview.

## HOW TO TEST

Visit the live site @ https://esedere-oghenetega-lendsqr-fe-test.netlify.app/ and navigate to the login page by clicking on the button on screen.
I created the landing page as the original test design did not have one and that made the whole application look pretty unappealing. Once you land on this page, you can login.
I have implemented the login functionality and created a mock login detail for the recruiter.

Username:- recruiter@lendsqr.com
Password:- lendsQrRecruiter

After logging in, you are routed to the Dashboard Home, which doesn't have any content.
You can navigate to the Users Page by clicking on the button provided or by using the side bar.
You can finally navigate to the User Details page by clicking on the options icon, and then view details.

These are the 4 pages that was required to be built.
Thanks.
